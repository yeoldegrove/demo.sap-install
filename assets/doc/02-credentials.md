# Credentials

In Automation Controller/AWX credentials are stored encrypted.
In addition to the standard credential types, the following custom credential types may be needed:

 - Credentials to register Red Hat subscriptions with an activation key
 - Credentials to download SAP software

## Configure Custom Credential Types

Go to `Administration` -> `Credential Types`

### Credentials to Register Systems to RHN with an Activation Key

The variables defined here are used in the role `mk_ansible_roles.subscribe_rhn`. You may use other ways to subscribe your RHEL system, then you don't need this.

1. Click `Add`
2. Enter the following:
    - `Name`: RHN activation
    - Input Configuration
      ```yaml
      fields:
        - id: activationkey
          type: string
          label: Activation Key
          secret: true
        - id: orgid
          type: string
          label: Organization ID
          secret: true
      required:
        - activationkey
        - orgid
      ```
    - Injector Creation:
      ```yaml
      ---
      extra_vars:
        reg_activation_key: '{{ activationkey }}'
        reg_organization_id: '{{ orgid }}'
      ```
3. Click `Save`

This creates a Form for injecting the two variable `reg_activation_key` and `reg_organization_id` to a job template (available to the playbook).
If you want to use username, password and pool id for registration, you can do so. Just create a similar template, injecting the variables `reg_username`, `reg_password` and `reg_pool` or `reg_pool_ids`


### SAP S-User Credentials

S-User credentials are needed  to download SAP Software

1. Click `Add`
2. Enter the following:
    - `Name`: SAP S-User
    - Input Configuration

      fields:
        - id: suser_id
          type: string
          label: SAP S-User ID
          secret: false
        - id: suser_password
          type: string
          label: SAP S-User password
          secret: true
      required:
        - suser_id
        - suser_password
      ```
    - Injector Creation:
      ```yaml
      ---
      extra_vars:
        suser_id: '{{ suser_id }}'
        suser_password: '{{ suser_password }}'
      ```
